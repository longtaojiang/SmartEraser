SmartEraser is a object removal model built on the novel Masked-Region Guidance paradigm. SmartEraser outperforms existing methods by smartly identifying the target object to remove while effectively preserving the surrounding context. To facilitate research on this paradigm, we propose Syn4Removal, a large-scale, high-quality dataset containing over a million image triplets, specifically designed for object removal tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SmartEraser achieves superior performance in both quality and robustness compared to previous object removal methods.

## Abstract
> Object removal has so far been dominated by "the mask-and-inpaint" paradigm, where the masked region is excluded from the input, leaving models relying on unmasked areas to inpaint the missing region. However, this approach lacks contextual information for the masked area, often resulting in unstable performance. In this work, we introduce SmartEraser, built with a new "removing" paradigm called Masked-Region Guidance. This paradigm retains the masked region in the input, using it as guidance for the removal process. It offers several distinct advantages: (a) it guides the model to accurately identify the object to be removed, preventing its regeneration in the output; (b) since the user mask often extends beyond the object itself, it aids in preserving the surrounding context in the final result. Leveraging this new paradigm, we present Syn4Removal, a large-scale object removal dataset, where instance segmentation data is used to copy and paste objects onto images as removal targets, with the original images serving as ground truths. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartEraser significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in object removal, especially in complex scenes with intricate compositions.
